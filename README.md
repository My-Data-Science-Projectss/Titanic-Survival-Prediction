# Titanic Survival Prediction 

A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, class, family size, and titles.  
This challenge is a classic introduction to binary classification problems in data science.

---

## Steps Taken
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted useful features such as:
  - Passenger titles (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)
  - Child indicator (Age < 12)
  - Name-based word counts  
- **Modeling:** Trained a **CatBoost Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using accuracy and precision on the test set.

---

## Results
- **Final Model:** CatBoost Classifier  
- **Leaderboard Score:** `0.82057` (Kaggle submission)  
- CatBoost performed well, balancing accuracy and generalization without overfitting.
